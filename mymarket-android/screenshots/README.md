# MyMarket
MyMarket is an app developed to help customers of an specific place (eg: city, neighborhood, etc) to consult the price of an specific product while they are into an specific market.

The price of the products are informed by the users themselves while they are into the markets, so they can collaborate with each other and find out if the price they are paying for an specific product if fair.
